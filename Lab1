### Lab 1 - Azure Architecture Considerations

@@@secondary
**Scenario**

The students will use the information gained in this module to demonstrate an understanding of Data Platform modernization, and why and how organizations should undertake a modernization project at a high level. They will demonstrate how to determine the cost of moving to Azure. They will also gather information about the environment that they are working on. Students will finally determine a data platform modernization strategy that should be used for a given scenario.

You have recently been hired as a senior data engineer at AdventureWorks and are working with a consultant and architects to initiate a Data Platform Modernization project that meets the organizations technical and business requirements. You will demonstrate an example of how they can calculate the Total Cost of Ownership of migrating to Azure. You then ask a Junior Data Engineer to collect information about the SQL Server that will be migrated to Azure. Then for a given scenario, you will advise the best Azure Data Platform Technology to migrate to for a given scenario.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

- Understand Data Platform Modernization
- Understand the Stages of Migration
- Data Migration Technologies

#### Exercise 3: Data Migration Technologies

@@@secondary
**Scenario**

In this exercise, you will select a data platform technology to help a customer migrate from an on-premises SQL Server to Azure

The main task for this exercise is as follows:

- Identify the database technology required to facilitate a migration in scenario A.
- Identify the database technology required to facilitate a migration in scenario B.
@@@

##### Task 1: Identify the database technology required to facilitate a migration in scenario A.

1. [ ] Read the following scenario
@@@info
The customer has an application that uses many databases currently residing in an on-premises version of Microsoft SQL Server 2008. The total database footprint is large, and rapidly growing by several terabytes per year. The existing SAN storage that the databases are located on is almost at capacity, expensive to expand, and nearing the end of its life. The application is critical to the company, with a moderate transaction rate, and any downtime would have significant business impact. Small maintenance windows are available in which to make changes to maximize the availability of the application. The high growth rate has seen more and more time being spent by DBAs and sysadmins just to keep everything running

1. [ ] From the scenario, which Database Platform Technology would be appropriate?

##### Task 2: Identify the database technology required to facilitate a migration in scenario B.

1. [ ] Read the following scenario
@@@info
The customer in this example has a SQL Server that stores databases that fulfil departmental needs. The server on which the databases are host is a quad core server, with 16GB of memory and is used as a backend to simple data access for spreadsheets and an Access form. There is a total of 6 databases that takes up 350 MB in total. The maximum number of concurrent connection to this server is 12.
